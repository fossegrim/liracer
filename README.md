# liracer
The free and open source code racing game.


~liracer is in public alpha and actively developed which means it's running on Heroku free tier(zzzzz), has bugs and downtime is probable. The latest release is available at https://liracer-rewrite.herokuapp.com/, soon to be moved to https://play.liracer.org.~

I am working on transferring the liracer app to https://play.liracer.org and building a landing page on https://liracer.org which means that there is currently no way to access the official liracer server, this will change soon.
