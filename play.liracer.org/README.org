To run liracer for development purposes run
#+begin_src sh
  CGO_ENABLED=0 ADDRESS=localhost:3003 go run -tags donotembed .
#+end_src

To build liracer for deployments run

#+begin_src sh
  CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags embed .
#+end_src


to cross compile to a different platfom set GOOS and GOARCH, for
example

#+begin_src sh :results output
  GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 CGO_ENABLED=0 time go build -tags embed . &> /dev/stdout
#+end_src


~CGO_ENABLED=0~ might not be strictly necessary, but I ran into a
problem today which was solved by adding this env variable so we might
as well just use it from now on. See
